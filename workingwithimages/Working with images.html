 <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>

 <p style="height:30%">When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought  me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has  given me a unique learning experience. 
    At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the  heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways  on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and  walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed <img style=float:left;width:300px;height:150px;border:1px;padding:10px; src="../workingwithimages/girl.jpeg" alt="girl"> lethat the thousand-year-old stones were still in place. It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.It began with French, which taught me the importance of  
    pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more on the A, she looked at me bewildered. In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English throug cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbo which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates  come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my  school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning  fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means  volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty  and rhythm as I form them.
